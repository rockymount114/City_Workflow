# City Workflow Approval System Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. TypeScript Excellence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code must be written in TypeScript with strict mode enabled (`strict: true`). No implicit any types allowed - all variables, parameters, and return values must be explicitly typed. Use discriminated unions for workflow states and application types. Define interfaces for all data models before implementation. Use const enums for application types (CIS, Munis) and approval stages.

**Rationale**: Type safety prevents runtime errors and enables better IDE support, refactoring, and maintainability at scale.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-Driven Development is mandatory. Write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement functionality. Coverage requirements: Utility functions 100%, Business logic 90%, React components 80%, Integration points 85%. Use Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests. All API routes must be tested with supertest. Mock external APIs (DocuSign, email service) but test real business logic.

**Rationale**: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability, enables confident refactoring, and documents expected behavior.

### III. User Experience First
Design mobile-first with responsive breakpoints (Mobile: < 640px, Tablet: 640px-1024px, Desktop: > 1024px). Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and minimum 4.5:1 color contrast. Use consistent design system with shadcn/ui components. Provide clear loading states, success messages, and user-friendly error handling with recovery suggestions.

**Rationale**: Accessible, responsive design ensures all users can effectively use the system regardless of device or ability.

### IV. Performance Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Page load performance targets: First Contentful Paint < 1.5s, Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5s, Time to Interactive < 3.5s. API response times: GET requests < 200ms (p95), POST/PUT requests < 500ms (p95). Total JS bundle must be < 300KB (gzipped). Use Next.js SSR/SSG, code splitting for heavy components, and optimized database queries with proper indexing.

**Rationale**: Fast performance is critical for user adoption and productivity in approval workflows.

### V. Security by Design
Implement NextAuth.js with secure session management. Enforce password policy (minimum 12 characters with complexity requirements). Support optional MFA. Use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with defined roles (Applicant, Approver L1, Approver L2, Admin). Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (HTTPS/TLS 1.3). Hash passwords with bcrypt (cost factor 12). Validate and sanitize all user inputs using Zod.

**Rationale**: Government systems require the highest security standards to protect sensitive approval data.

### VI. Multi-Level Workflow Engine
Support minimum 2, maximum 5 approval levels per application type. Enable configurable approval chains per application type with sequential flow requirements. Support parallel approvals at the same level. Provide clear approval actions: Approve, Reject (with required comments), Request Changes, Delegate. Maintain complete audit trail of all workflow actions.

**Rationale**: Flexible workflow configuration accommodates diverse city department approval processes.

### VII. Integration Excellence
DocuSign integration must use OAuth 2.0 with authorization code grant flow. Securely store refresh tokens encrypted in database. Validate HMAC signatures on all DocuSign webhooks. Email notifications via SendGrid/AWS SES with queue system (Bull/BullMQ) for reliable delivery. Implement 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff for failed notifications.

**Rationale**: Reliable integrations ensure smooth document signing and notification workflows.

### VIII. Monitoring & Observability
Implement comprehensive logging with immutable, append-only audit logs retained for 7 years. Track application metrics (submission rate, approval time, rejection reasons) and performance metrics (page load times, API latency, error rates). Set up real-time dashboards for admin visibility. Configure alerts for critical errors and performance degradation.

**Rationale**: Observability enables proactive issue resolution and continuous improvement of approval processes.

### IX. Code Organization Standards
Organize code by feature (auth, applications, approvals, notifications). Each function/component must serve one clear purpose. Extract shared logic into utilities or hooks. Follow naming conventions: Components (PascalCase), Functions (camelCase), Constants (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE). Maximum 300 lines per file - refactor if exceeded.

**Rationale**: Consistent organization improves maintainability and enables team scalability.

### X. Continuous Deployment Excellence
Automated testing must pass on every commit. Use preview deployments for each PR. Implement blue-green deployment with rollback capability. All database migrations must have rollback scripts. Maintain staging environment mirroring production configuration. Target 99.9% uptime SLA.

**Rationale**: Reliable deployment processes minimize downtime and enable rapid, safe feature delivery.

## Quality Standards

### Code Review Requirements
All PRs require at least one approval. ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript compiler must pass. Complex logic must include inline comments explaining "why" not "what". Peer review must verify constitution compliance. No direct commits to main branch - all changes via PR.

### Documentation Standards
Every feature must include: API documentation, User guide, Admin configuration guide, Troubleshooting guide. Keep documentation in sync with code changes. Use clear, concise language suitable for city government staff.

## Security Requirements

### Data Protection
All sensitive data must be encrypted at rest using AES-256. Implement field-level encryption for PII. Use secure key management practices. Regular security audits required. Never commit API keys or credentials to Git.

### Access Control
Implement principle of least privilege. Regular access reviews quarterly. Automatic session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity. Log all authentication and authorization events.

## Performance Standards

### Scalability Targets
Support 1000+ concurrent users. Handle 100 requests/minute per user. Database connection pooling (max 20 connections). Horizontal scaling capability with stateless API design.

### Resource Management
Implement proper caching strategies (Redis for sessions, Next.js cache for static content). Use CDN for static assets. Monitor memory usage and implement cleanup procedures.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
1. Documentation of proposed changes with rationale
2. Impact analysis on existing features
3. Approval from technical lead and product owner
4. Migration plan for existing code if applicable

All development must reference this constitution. Complexity must be justified against simplicity principles. Regular compliance reviews monthly. Use `/speckit.checklist` command to verify constitution compliance during development.
