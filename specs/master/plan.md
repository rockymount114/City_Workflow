# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a comprehensive login and approval system for city government applications including CIS and Munis. The system features multi-level approval workflows (2-5 levels), role-based access control, and supports 1000+ concurrent users with 99.9% uptime. Technical approach uses Next.js 14 with TypeScript strict mode, NextAuth.js for authentication, PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, and Redis for caching. Includes DocuSign integration, email notifications, audit trails, and mobile-first responsive design meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with strict mode enabled
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14, NextAuth.js, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, React 18, Node.js 20
**Storage**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing and relationships, Redis for session caching
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest for API testing
**Target Platform**: Web application (Next.js SSR/SSG), Mobile-first responsive design
**Project Type**: Web application with separate frontend/backend concerns
**Performance Goals**: Page load < 1.5s FCP, API response < 200ms (GET), < 500ms (POST), Support 1000+ concurrent users
**Constraints**: Government security standards, 99.9% uptime SLA, 7-year audit trail retention, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
**Scale/Scope**: 1000+ concurrent users, 100 requests/minute per user, multi-department city government deployment

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I. TypeScript Excellence | ✅ PASS | Strict TypeScript with explicit typing planned |
| II. Test-First Development | ✅ PASS | TDD with Jest + React Testing Library planned |
| III. User Experience First | ✅ PASS | Mobile-first, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance planned |
| IV. Performance Standards | ✅ PASS | Targets: FCP < 1.5s, API < 200ms/500ms |
| V. Security by Design | ✅ PASS | NextAuth.js, RBAC, bcrypt, input validation |
| VI. Multi-Level Workflow Engine | ✅ PASS | 2-5 approval levels, configurable chains |
| VII. Integration Excellence | ✅ PASS | DocuSign OAuth 2.0, email queue system |
| VIII. Monitoring & Observability | ✅ PASS | Audit logs, metrics, dashboards planned |
| IX. Code Organization Standards | ✅ PASS | Feature-based structure planned |
| X. Continuous Deployment Excellence | ✅ PASS | Automated testing, preview deployments |

**All constitution principles satisfied - proceeding with Phase 0 research.**

**Structure Decision**: Next.js App Router structure with feature-based organization, following constitution requirement for code organization by feature (auth, applications, approvals, notifications).

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
