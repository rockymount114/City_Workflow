# City Workflow Approval System - Login and Application Management

## Overview

Build a comprehensive login system for users and administrators with approval processes for different city applications including CIS (City Information System) and Munis (Municipal Information System). The system will support multi-level approval workflows with role-based access control.

## Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User Login**: Standard authentication for city employees requesting access to applications
- **Admin Login**: Administrative interface for managing applications and approval processes
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permission levels for Applicants, Approvers (L1, L2), and Admins
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity

### User Features (Approval Process)
- **Application Selection**: Choose from available applications (CIS, Munis, etc.)
- **Request Form**: Fill out application-specific fields:
  - Requester name, email, department, work phone, employeeID, division, supervisor name
  - Application-specific requirements (CIS Prod, TEST, or Both)
  - Account type selection (new account, existing account, lock account)
- **Justification**: Text input for business justification
- **Role Assignment**: Select required roles for different application groups:
  - BSC Billing Workshop
  - Engineering
  - Finance
  - Other department-specific roles
- **Status Tracking**: View approval status and history

### Admin Features (Application Management)
- **Application Configuration**: Add new applications with custom fields
- **Approval Workflow Setup**: Configure multi-level approval chains (2-5 levels)
- **User Management**: Manage user accounts and permissions
- **Approval Processing**: Review and approve/reject requests with comments
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all approval actions
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on approval metrics and user activity

### Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, mobile-first responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing and relationships
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with secure session management
- **Security**: Input validation, encryption, HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- **Performance**: Page load < 1.5s, API response < 200ms (GET), < 500ms (POST)
- **Testing**: TDD approach with Jest, React Testing Library
- **Integrations**: DocuSign for document signing, email notifications

### Application Types
1. **CIS (City Information System)**
   - Production environment access (Prod, Test, Both)
   - Role-based permissions (Billing, Engineering, Finance, etc.)
   - Account management (new, existing, lock)

2. **Munis (Municipal Information System)**
   - Similar structure to CIS with municipal-specific roles
   - Integration with city financial systems

3. **Custom Applications**
   - Configurable fields per application
   - Flexible approval workflows
   - Department-specific requirements

### Workflow States
- **Draft**: User can save and edit later
- **Submitted**: Awaiting approval
- **Under Review**: Being reviewed by approvers
- **Approved**: Access granted
- **Rejected**: Access denied with comments
- **Changes Requested**: User needs to provide additional information

### Multi-Level Approval
- Minimum 2, maximum 5 approval levels per application
- Sequential approval flow required
- Parallel approvals allowed at same level
- Approval actions: Approve, Reject (with comments), Request Changes, Delegate

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully register and login
- Approval requests can be submitted with all required fields
- Admins can configure applications and approval workflows
- Multi-level approval process works correctly
- System meets performance and security requirements
- All audit trails are properly maintained
- Mobile-responsive design works across devices

## Constraints
- Must comply with city government security standards
- Must integrate with existing city systems where applicable
- Must support 1000+ concurrent users
- Must maintain 99.9% uptime
- Must preserve 7-year audit trail
- Must be accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
