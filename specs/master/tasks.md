## Dependencies & Execution Order

### User Story Dependencies

```
US1 (Authentication) → US2 (Request Submission) → US3 (Approval Workflow)
                              ↓
                        US4 (Admin Management)
```

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Each User Story Phase**:
- Models and repositories can be created in parallel [P]
- API endpoints can be implemented in parallel [P]
- Frontend components can be built in parallel [P]
- Tests can be written in parallel with implementation [P]

**Cross-Phase Parallelism**:
- Email integration (Phase 7) can run parallel with US3
- Performance optimization (Phase 8) can run parallel with US4
- Security hardening (Phase 8) can run parallel with integration work

### Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP Scope**: Complete Phase 1-3 (Setup, Foundation, US1) for basic authentication
2. **Core Functionality**: Add Phase 4 (US2) for request submission
3. **Workflow Engine**: Add Phase 5 (US3) for approval processing
4. **Admin Features**: Add Phase 6 (US4) for management capabilities
5. **Production Ready**: Complete Phase 7-8 for integrations and polish

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Each service and utility function
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows (registration → login → submit request → approve)
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for 1000+ concurrent users
- **Security Tests**: Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
