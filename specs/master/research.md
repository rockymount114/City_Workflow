# Research Phase - City Workflow Approval System

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. NextAuth.js Implementation Patterns
**Decision**: Use NextAuth.js with Credentials Provider and JWT sessions
**Rationale**: NextAuth.js provides secure, production-ready authentication with built-in CSRF protection, session management, and support for multiple providers. JWT sessions offer better performance for high-concurrency government systems.
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom JWT implementation (rejected: too much security risk)
- Auth0 (rejected: vendor lock-in, ongoing costs for government)

### 2. Database Design for Multi-Level Workflows
**Decision**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, using adjacency list pattern for workflow chains
**Rationale**: PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance required for audit trails, excellent JSON support for flexible application fields, and mature full-text search. Prisma offers type-safe database access and excellent migration support.
**Alternatives Considered**:
- MongoDB (rejected: lacks ACID transactions for financial workflows)
- MySQL (rejected: inferior JSON support and full-text search)

### 3. State Management for Complex Workflows
**Decision**: Use database-driven state with React Query for frontend state synchronization
**Rationale**: Workflow state must be centralized in database for audit consistency. React Query provides excellent caching and synchronization patterns for multi-user approval systems.
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux (rejected: unnecessary complexity for server-driven state)
- Zustand (rejected: client-side state insufficient for workflow consistency)

### 4. Form Validation and Error Handling
**Decision**: Zod for schema validation with react-hook-form for form management
**Rationale**: Zod provides TypeScript-first validation with excellent error messages. react-hook-form offers performance optimization for complex forms with many fields.
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Yup (rejected: slower performance, larger bundle size)
- Joi (rejected: server-side only, no TypeScript integration)

### 5. Email Notification System
**Decision**: Bull queue with SendGrid for reliable email delivery
**Rationale**: Bull provides Redis-backed queue with retry logic and exponential backoff. SendGrid offers government-grade email delivery with high deliverability rates.
**Alternatives Considered**:
- AWS SES (rejected: complex setup for city IT infrastructure)
- Nodemailer direct (rejected: no built-in retry/queue management)

### 6. Document Integration Strategy
**Decision**: DocuSign OAuth 2.0 with webhook validation for document signing
**Rationale**: DocuSign is government-approved e-signature platform with robust API. OAuth 2.0 provides secure token management, webhook validation ensures document completion integrity.
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Adobe Sign (rejected: higher costs, less government adoption)
- Custom PDF signing (rejected: legal compliance issues)

### 7. Performance Optimization Strategy
**Decision**: Next.js SSR/SSG with Redis caching, database query optimization, and code splitting
**Rationale**: SSR provides fast initial page loads, SSG for static content, Redis caching reduces database load, proper indexing ensures query performance under load.
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Client-side rendering only (rejected: poor SEO, slower initial load)
- Full static generation (rejected: dynamic approval data requires SSR)

### 8. Security Implementation Patterns
**Decision**: Defense in depth with input validation, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, CSRF tokens, and rate limiting
**Rationale**: Government systems require multiple security layers. Next.js built-in security features combined with custom validation provide comprehensive protection.
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Minimal security (rejected: government compliance requirements)
- Third-party security services (rejected: vendor dependency, costs)

### 9. Audit Trail Implementation
**Decision**: Immutable audit logs with PostgreSQL triggers and separate audit table
**Rationale**: Database triggers ensure no audit entry can be bypassed, separate audit table prevents tampering, 7-year retention meets government requirements.
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Application-level logging (rejected: can be bypassed or modified)
- External audit service (rejected: additional complexity and costs)

### 10. Mobile-First Design System
**Decision**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for consistent, accessible design
**Rationale**: shadcn/ui provides accessible, customizable components that meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Tailwind enables rapid development with consistent spacing and colors.
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Material-UI (rejected: less customizable for government branding)
- Bootstrap (rejected: dated design patterns, accessibility issues)

## Key Technical Decisions Summary

1. **Architecture**: Next.js full-stack with App Router, TypeScript strict mode
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM, proper indexing and relationships
3. **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT sessions, bcrypt password hashing
4. **State Management**: Database-driven with React Query synchronization
5. **Forms**: react-hook-form with Zod validation
6. **Queue System**: Bull with Redis for email notifications and background jobs
7. **Integrations**: DocuSign OAuth 2.0, SendGrid for emails
8. **Security**: Multi-layer validation, encryption, audit trails
9. **Performance**: SSR/SSG, caching, code splitting, database optimization
10. **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, TDD approach

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

1. **High Concurrency**: Database connection pooling, Redis caching, horizontal scaling
2. **Security Threats**: Regular security audits, penetration testing, dependency scanning
3. **Data Loss**: Automated backups, disaster recovery plan, database replication
4. **Performance Degradation**: Monitoring and alerting, performance budgets, load testing
5. **Integration Failures**: Circuit breaker patterns, fallback mechanisms, retry logic

## Compliance Considerations

- **Government Security Standards**: Implement all required security controls
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Data Retention**: 7-year audit trail retention with immutable logs
- **Privacy**: PII encryption, data minimization, secure data handling
- **Legal Compliance**: Electronic signature legal requirements, approval authority validation
