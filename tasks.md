## Dependencies & Execution Order

### User Story Dependencies

```
US1 (Registration) → US2 (Login) → US3 (Admin Dashboard)
                              ↓
                        US4 (User Management) → US5 (Application Management)
                              ↓
                        US6 (Advanced Features)
```

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Within Each Phase**:
- Frontend components can be built in parallel [P]
- API endpoints can be implemented in parallel [P]
- Services can be created in parallel [P]
- Tests can be written in parallel with implementation [P]

**Cross-Phase Parallelism**:
- UI components (Phase 3) can be built while backend features are being implemented
- Testing (Phase 4) can be done incrementally as features are completed
- Documentation (Phase 5) can be written during development

### Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP Scope**: Complete Phase 1 (Authentication) for basic functionality
2. **Core Admin Features**: Add Phase 2 (Admin Dashboard and User Management)
3. **Full Management**: Add Application Management (US5)
4. **Advanced Features**: Complete with US6 and full testing
5. **Production Ready**: Deploy with proper documentation and monitoring

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Each service and utility function
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows (register → login → admin operations)
- **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, and input validation
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing for admin operations

---

**Total Tasks**: 131
**Parallel Tasks**: 45+
**Estimated Implementation Time**: 3-4 weeks with parallel execution

**Priority Order**: US1 → US2 → US3 → US4 → US5 → US6
